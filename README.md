# Smart Door Lock E-KTP with Arduino Nano

This project involves creating a smart door lock system using an Arduino Nano microcontroller and electronic identity cards (E-KTP) for authentication. The system allows users to unlock the door by swiping their E-KTP, providing a convenient and secure access control mechanism.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following main components:

### Hardware Setup
The hardware setup involves connecting components such as RFID reader module, servo motor, and Arduino Nano microcontroller according to the circuit diagram provided.

### Software Implementation
The software implementation includes programming the Arduino Nano to interface with the RFID reader module, authenticate E-KTP cards, and control the servo motor to unlock the door.

### Authentication Mechanism
Users can authenticate themselves by swiping their E-KTP cards over the RFID reader module. The system verifies the card's information and grants access if authentication is successful.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the smart door lock system, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the RFID reader module and servo motor to the Arduino Nano according to the provided circuit diagram.
   
2. **Software Installation:**
   - Install the necessary libraries and dependencies for Arduino development.
   
3. **Upload Code:**
   - Upload the Arduino sketch provided in the repository to the Arduino Nano using the Arduino IDE or any compatible IDE.
   
4. **Test System:**
   - Test the system by swiping a registered E-KTP card over the RFID reader module. Ensure that the door unlocks upon successful authentication.
